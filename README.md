# csharp

be warned ye who dare take this course

for temptation is an ocean as vast as regret

thou test cases are sparse and deceiving

inputs and outputs aplenty


methods, classes and fields

dripping with indulgent remedies

unused variables litter the screen

as dread stfiles ye fingers


thy scope is elusive and strict

errors and warnings art relentless

constructors be thine lonely friend

as exceptions endue you with rage


countless hours spent sulking on thy keys

for every hour feels dateless

'a curse upon you recodex' you scream, tormented

but remember 'tis what ye brought upon thyself
